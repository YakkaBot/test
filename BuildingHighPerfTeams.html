<h2 id="1">Creating a compelling vision and mission</h2>
<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>
<h3 id="1a">Vision: A clear picture of where you want to be in 3-5 years.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Be ambitions but realistic.
<li> It should be worth doing and resonate on a personal level so folks want to reach that goal.
<li> It should be differentiated from your competitors.
<li> It needs to be concise and use precision, no buzz words.
</ul>

<h3 id="1b">Mission: A statement that is the cultural reflection of the values and beliefs of the organization.</h3>
<ul>
<li> Articulate how your team creates value for the organization or customer.
<li> Clear brief and understandable by all employees.
<li> Should be clear to outsiders how this team contributes to the company.
<li> Clearly specify what business the team is in.
<li> Worded as a rallying cry to the rest of the organization.
</ul>

<b>How to create the Vision and Mission</b>
<ul>
<li> Get the relevant stakeholders in a room.
<li> Use whiteboards or flip charts.
<li> Facilitate the discussion with stakeholders, let them do the talking.
<li> Ask questions
	<ul>
	<li> What value do our customers get from interacting with us?
	<li> What differentiates us from our competitors?
	<li> What do we aspire to be in 3-5 years from now?
	</ul>
<li> Write answers on whiteboards.
<li> When energy leaves the room give folks a break.
<li> Look for terms and concepts that are repeated multiple times. 
<li> Take those common words and write them on a new sheet.
<li> Ask how we can take those terms and turn them in to clear and simple statements.
<li> Write that draft vision or mission statement out. Make it something the people can react to.
<li> For the Vision statement, Ask...
	<ul>
	<li> Is this something we can achieve in 5 years?
	<li> Would we be excited to achieve this vision?
	<li> If we got there would we feel like we had achieved something great?
	</ul>
<li> For the mission statement, Ask...
	<ul>
	<li>Does this mission truly describe why we exist and what we are passionate about.
	<li>Does it explain how we as a team create value for our customers? Both internal and external.
	<li>Can people make decisions and take actions if they understand why we exist? 
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="1c">Building a shared purpose</h3>
Translate the vision and mission into a shared purpose and define how that can drive behavior.<br>
<br>
<b> Shared purpose</b><br>
The shared purpose if the connection between your mission / vision and the customer you serve.<br>
Start with the mission: Why we exist and how we get there.<br>
Combine that with the vision: The destination after a few years of fulfilling your mission.<br>
Think more broadly about your customers and ask how you can involve them in the achievement of the mission and vision.<br>
<!-- TODO:We should research the shared purpose more.-->

<h3 id="1d">Strategy</h3>
You must link your mission and vision to the initiatives the team will pursue, otherwise defining a mission and vision is irrelevant and you will pursue a strategy that is inconsistent with where you are trying to go.<br>
<br>

<b>Setting a strategy</b>
<ul> 
<li> Define your core competencies.
<li> Articulate strategic filters.
<li> Run all initiatives through filters to prioritize.
</ul>
 
<b>Core competencies</b><br>
What your team does better than anyone else.
<ul>
<li> Define your team's 2 core competencies.
<li> Specify one as primary and the other as secondary.
<li> Filter and prioritize initiatives ...
	<ul>
	<li> Initiatives that employ both competencies should be high priority.
	<li> Initiatives that employ neither should be discarded.
	<li> Initiatives that employ either primary or secondary might be considered and prioritized with primary higher.
	</ul>
</ul>

<b>Articulate Strategic filters</b><br>
Strategic filters are the evaluation criteria for initiatives. It's the criteria that's most important to your organization and the achievement of the organizations goals.<br>
The strategic filters may be qualitative or quantitative...<br>
Qualitative  - E.g. Does this initiative help us grow internationally? Does it advance our technology platform? Does it help raise our teams profile? <br>
Quantitative - E.g. What is the ROI of this initiative? <br>
Note: Need to better define this section.<br>
<br>
<!-- TODO: Investigate more about strategic filters-->

<b>Run initiatives through the strategic filters</b><br>
We use the strategic filters to evaluate and sort each of our initiatives relative to each other.<br>
<br>

<b>Strategic planning cycle</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Set strategy by articulating the vision and mission
<li>Decided what initiatives to take on based on core competencies.
<li>Have articulated strategic filters to evaluate the initiatives we will pursue and prioritize them.
</ul>

The priority list should drive the organizational structure and the resource planning for how we will get the initiative done. Finally, we will align individuals' capabilities with the org structure.


<h2 id="2">Gathering and Deploying Resources</h2>
<h3>Resource types</h3>
Three types of resources to consider...
<ul>
<li>Hard Resources
	<ul>
	<li> Cash
	<li> Equipment
	<li> Information / data
	</ul>
<li>People
	<ul>
	<li> Skill sets
	<li> Quantity
	</ul>
<li>Leadership time and access.
	<ul>
	<li> Manage, direct and develop people.
	<li> Take care of business needs.
	<li> Take care of the people needs (morale, culture, development)
	</ul>
</ul>


<h3 id="2a">Defining your resource needs</h3><br>
Resource needs are driven by the work that needs to get done, not the other way around.<br>
<ul>
<li> Start with the list of initiatives, in priority order.
<li> Build a bottom-up forecast.
	<ul>
	<li> Define the resources you will need for each initiative.
	<li> Consider the business as usual daily work that needs to happen.
	</ul>
<li> Add up all the resource requirements. This is what your team needs to be successful.
</ul>

<h3 id="2b">Making the case for more resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review the prioritized list of initiatives.
<li>Document the business as usual resources needed.
<li>Ask for resources
</ul>
<br>
<b>To request resources</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Get explicit agreement from stakeholders (management) that the prioritized list of initiatives is appropriate.
<li>Also get agreement that the business as usual work needs to be completed.
<li>Explain the initiatives that can be delivered with the resources available.
</ul>

<h3 id="2c">Make time a high-priority resource</h3>
Leaders need to focus on feedback, relationships, and problem solving.<br>
Make an effort to spend less time on administration, some time on planning and more time on coaching and development.<br>
Be deliberate about time management, think how long a task will take and what return will I get from that commitment.<br>

<h2 id="3">Assembling the team</h2>
<!-- TODO: Review and improve this section.-->
<h3 id="3a">Creating the right skill mix</h3>
<ul>
<li> Map out the skills required to succeed.
<li> Assess if your team has those skills.
<li> Determine if the team is a good fit with the culture.
</ul>

<b>Team skills required</b><br>
Identify required skills based on the initiatives that you want to pursue. Then create role-based skill competencies, based on the required skills.<br>
Some examples of skills...<br>
Technical: coding, analysis, writing, etc.<br>
Functional: problem solving, strategy, decision making, communicating, presenting, etc.<br>
Role-based / cultural: leader, devils advocate, optimist, taskmaster, etc.<br>
<br>
<b>Assess the team</b>
<ul>
<li> List out the team members current skills.
<li> Evaluate each persons performance detractors.
<li> Determine if each person is suitable for the project.
</ul>
Note: We can use the gaps between a persons skill set and the competencies they require as part of their career development plan.

<h3  id="3b">Determine if folks are a good fit</h3>
<ul>
<li> Look at the the list of remaining required skills and hire or obtain folks with those skills.
</ul>

<b>Recruiting the right people</b>
<ul>
<li> Use the role-based competency to create the job description. However avoid being overly specific as this may narrow the candidate base.
<li> Hire from non-traditional sources. - you may find different candidates and get new ideas / perspectives. eg: don't hire from Harvard business school, go to a lesser university and get their best people.
<li> Think one role ahead to people has "headroom" to grow. - People enjoy overcoming obstacles. Make sure they can do 70% of the role and need to learn 30%.
<li> Make sure you are inclusive, use tools that check the language of your JD to ensure it appeals to minorities.
</ul>

<h3  id="3c">Creating chemistry and trust</h3>
Building chemistry is about personalities and shared beliefs.<br>
<ul>
<li> Make sure everyone is involved in the interview process.
<li> Use personality style tools to assess communication prefernces and work styles. E.g. Myers brigs.
<li> Work on identifying shared beliefs/values and build up from there.
</ul>
Trust is about <b>shared experiences</b> and <b>predictability</b>.<br>
Shared experiences show people how others react during stressful situations. This may come from putting folks on a large project together, having them share a goal of achieving a high metric, or through offsites and training sessions.<br>
Creating shared experiences allows people to feel like they can rely on each other to achieve goals.
They start feeling responsible for each other's wellbeing and will look out for each other.<br>
Predictability is about knowing how colleagues will react in certain situations.<br>
Past behavior is as good a predictor of future behavior.<br>
<br>

<h2 id="4">Allocating Work and Prioritizing</h2>
<h3 id="4a">Balancing workload</h3>
Work allocation needs to be done fairly (not necessarily evenly). Allocate work based on...<br>
<ol type="1">
<li> Priority - driven by the teams and organizations goals.
<li> Skill set - Ensures a high-quality result.
<li> Availability - If you have available resources, use them. 
<li> Development Opportunity - Give the team work where they will learn new skills.
<li> Interest - Let people take on projects they are passionate about.
</ol>

<h3 id="4b">Setting goals</h3>
Goals should be <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm">S.M.A.R.T</a><br>
Set appropriate commit and stretch goals.<br>
<b>Commit goal</b> - A promise that you will deliver.<br>
<ul>
<li>Attainable</li>
<li>Obligate to deliver it</li>
<li>Consequences for missing, no bonus, no raise, etc.</li>
<li>Beware of sandbagging</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Stretch goal</b> - If everything goes perfect, and with some luck, we hit our goal.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Big and audacious, people should feel somewhat uncomfortable to deliver.</li>
	<li>No negative consequences of missing.</li>
	<li>Beware of sandbagging</li>
</ul>

We should tie commit and stretch goals to compensation. Achieving commit goals gets the minimum compensation, achieving stretch goals gets max bonus.<br>

<h3 id="4c">Prioritizing your efforts</h3>
<!-- TODO: This whole section needs revision. -->
<b>Evaluation filters</B> - Objective criteria for comparing initiatives.<br>
<br>
Strategic filters - Should be based on the objectives of the organization.<br>
Every initiative should be evaluated against each of the strategic filters to determine if the objective passes or fails.<br>
E.g. If an organizational goal is "to increase the visibility of SRE in the Org", then a strategic filter would be, "Increase SRE visability"

<h3 id="4d">Matching priorities and resources</h3>
Once we have screened our initiatives through our strategic filters, we will to create a stack ranked list of initiatiaves in priority order.<br>
For each initiative, document the resources needed to complete each initiative.<br>
Look at the available resources, and allocate until you run out of resources. Mark them in a different color.<br>

<h2 id="5">Executing the plan</h2>
<h3 id="5a">Making decisions</h3>

Decision making process: Prepare -> Decide -> Communicate -> Execute -> Measure & Adjust.<br>

Styles of Decision making
<ul>
	<li> Autocratic - Decisions made at the top.
	<li> Participatory  - decisions reached with input from those affected.
	<li> Democratic - decisions reached by majority vote.
	<li> Consensus - decisions reached by consensus from a cross-functional team.
</ul>
The right decision-making style depends on the <b>urgency</b> and <b>size of the decision.</b>.<br>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Urgency</th>
		<th>Size</th>
		<th>Style</th>
		<th>Comment</th>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Low</td>
		<td>Small</td>
		<td>Democratic</td>
		<td>We can vote on small things, people feel involved.</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Low</td>
		<td>Big</td>
		<td>Consensus</td>
		<td>We have time to hash out the right decision.</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>High</td>
		<td>Small</td>
		<td>Autocratic</td>
		<td>It's a small decision, don't involve too many folks.</td>
	</tr>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>High</td>
		<td>Big</td>
		<td>Participatory</td>
		<td>We want a lot of input to make sure I make the right call<br>But not everyone, just the necessary folks<br> Get folks bought in to the decision.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<br>
<b>Kinds of decisions</b><br>
<ul>
<li>No downside
<li>Favorable odds
<li>Going for broke
</ul>

<h3 id="5b">Putting the organization first</h3>
Personal agenda and politics can derail the performance of your entire team.<br>
Savvy - Knowing who is influencial and how to get things done.<br>
Political - Doing things for personal gain.<br>
We want to minimize the latter. To know the difference simply ask if the decision in the best interests of the organization?<br>

<h3 id="5c">Measuring and adjusting</h3>
<!-- TODO: Rework this section.-->
<b style=color:red>This sections does not look correct/complete!</b><br>
<b>Tips for effective meetings</b>
<ul>
	<li> Share information ahead of time: Create an agenda, share documents and require they be reviewed, if too many people have not reviewed then reschedule.<br>
	<li> Define the meeing purpose and agenda: ensure the right folks are present and prepared with the info they need.
	<li>Manage by exception: Discuss only major variances, ignore metrics that meet goal.
	<li>80/20 rule, focus on the metrics or items that matter. If the project is meeting goal or the metric is being me, mention it then move on.
	<li>Review standing meetings: Cancel meetings that are no longer necessary.
	<li>Communicate decisions: Immediately after the meeting with the wider group.
</ul>

<h2 id="6">Motivating people and resolving conflict</h2>
<h3 id="6a">Empowering people</h3>

The measure of a good leader is to set the goal and stand back, accept that there are different ways of doing things and they may be less efficient.<br>
Consider setting boundaries and only course correct if people are outside the boundaries.<br>
<!-- TODO: Add a section about situational leadership.-->
Note: Situational leadership.

<h3 id="6b">Giving authority with responsibility</h3>
Accountability - the responsibility to monitor and report on events or experiences. The job of being accountable for something should be assigned to a single individual who’s duty it is to monitor a specific task, process, service or KPI.<br>
Responsibility - the duty and ability to respond or take action. Giving someone responsibility for a task, task, process, service or KPI means that it is the role of that person(s) to do the task. It can be assigned to multiple people.<br>
Authority - is the power or right to give orders or make decisions.<br>

Empowerment is one key to employee satisfaction with their work. It requires managers to trust employee decisions. <br>
It is not fair to hold people responsible for areas where they can't make decisions.<br>
Make folks accountable by giving them the authority to make decisions, they should be excited to take responsibility to achieve the result.<br>

<a href="http://www.tightship.io/stop-confusing-accountability-vs-responsibility-vs-authority/">Accountability v Responsability v Authority</a>

<h3 id="6c">Resolving Conflict</h3>
Avoid mediating your teams conflicts. Teach your team to resolve conflicts on their own.<br>

The managers role in conflict resolution...
<ul>
<li> Recognize it.
<li> Give them control to figure it out.
</ul>
Teach them to resolve the conflict...
<ul>
<li> Acknowledge the conflict.
<li> Focus on the facts and get to the root of the issue.
<li> Have the team define a goal for resolution and what the desired behavours should be.
</ul>

Mediate as a last resource. If you must mediate, talk them through the resolution one step at a time.
<ul>
<li> What is the issue? Let them describe it and figure it out.
<li> What are the emotions? Why are they coming up, how are those emotions getting in the way of a resolution.
</ul>
For each steps of the conflict resolution process, identify alternatives and desired behaviors, 

<h3 id="6d">Providing feedback</h3>
Note: Course - Having Difficult conversations.
If we want people to improve we have to give them feedback.<br>
We want to remove emotion and help the person focus on a specific behavour and a specific change that is delivered in a non-threatening way.<br>


<b>Core feedback model</b>
<ul>
<li> Ask for permission. Ensure that, at that moment, they are open to receiving feedback.
<li> Offer a fact-based observation and confirm they recall it.
<li> Explain how it made you feel, or the impact it had on someone else in the team.
<li> Ask if they can see why their behavior impacted me that way?
<li> Request behavioral change and ask for commitment.
<li> They commit to change
<li> Offer assistance to make change. Ask if there are things I can be doing differently.
</ul>

<h3 id="6e">Celebrating success and accepting failure</h3>

<b>Celebrating success</b><br>
Communicate success to the team. It builds momentum and folks will feel proud to be associated with a team doing such great things.<br>
Some ways of recognizing success include...
<ul>
<li> Bonuses
<li> Visibility
<li> Public recognition 
<li> Increased responsibility
<li> Promotions
</ul>
Find out what motivates them <b>personally</b> and reward accordingly.<br>
Eg:<br>
<ul>
<li>An introvert may not want to go on stage to be publicly recognized.<br>
<li>Someone may be happy with their level of responsibilities, so don't promote them unnecessarily.<br>
</ul>

<b>Accepting failure</b><br>
Find the opportunity to turn failures in to lessons learned.<br>
Fail as a team, try to never make it about the individual.<br>
Identify the root causes, was it a process failure, communication, etc. <br>
Make sure to praise people for taking a risk and give consideration to how we can reduce the risk next time.<br>

<h2 id="7">Developing the team</h2>
<h3 id="7a">Building individual capabilities</h3>
We want to help high achievers identify the places they need to grow and giving them the opportunity to learn those skills.<br>
<br>

<b>Identifying skill gaps</b>
<ul>
<li> Define skills required based on role-competency descriptions.
<li> Assess an individual's skills versus the competencies.
</ul>

<b>Developing individuals.</b>
<ul>
<li> Ask why there is a skill gap, is it training?, Opportunity?
<li> Get agreement on what the gap is and why it exists. - Sit down with the individual and ask why they think the gap exists. Help them understand where they currently perform, where you expect them to perform and what that gap looks like in terms of skills you should be seeing every day.
<li> Document the resolution as their individual development plan.
<li> Ask for their commitment to fill those gaps.
<li> Identify specific projects or deliverables that the individual can own.
</ul>

<h3 id="7b">Building bench strength and succession plans</h3>
Over-reliance on individuals can be very dangerous. We want to cross train folks to avoid anyone single points of reliance. Undertake succession planning, to have coverage in case folks do leave, and have a bench so we can fill gaps quickly.<br>
<br>
<b>Cross training benefits.</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Builds redundancy
<li> Gives people the opportunity to grow.
<li> Helps folks learn how to train and develop others.
</ul>
<b>Succession planning.</b><br>
It's important to know who would fill a role if someone departs. Successors should know they are being prepared for growth.<br>
<br>
<b>Building a talent pipeline.</b><br>
Have a shortlist of people in mind for people both within and outside the organization. This allows us to fill roles faster, with better, more qualified talent.<br>

<h3 id="7c">Creating stretch assignments</h3>
Balancing between stretching their abilities and taking on risks.<br>
Use the 70/30 rule, they should be able to complete 70% very easily, the incremental 30% is their opportunity to grow.<br>
Where possible, where you have tasks that you can do easily and for employees would be a stretch, have them take ownership of those tasks. It will free you up and give them the opportunity to grow.<br>

<h3 id="7d">Being a net exporter of talent</h3>

If you hoard high performers, you will likely run out of opportunities for them and they will leave.<br>
If you help high performers with expanded opportunities or find them new roles outside your org, your org will get a reputation for developing folks and the best folks will gravitate to your team.<br>

<h2 id="8">Next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li> Create a draft of the high-performing team plan.
<li> Discuss the plan and goals with the team and get input for change.
<li> Document the final plan and get their commitment to execute it.
<li> Prioritize efforts.
<li> Measure impact against specific goals.
</ul>
