<h2 id="1">Understanding Emotional intelligence</h2>
<h3 id="1a">What is emotional intelligence</h3>
The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.<br>
EQ is more than twice as likely to predict success.<br>
Personal Competence<br>
Relational competence<br>
<br>
<b>Self Awareness</b> - How well you know yourself in comparison to how others perceive you. What are my strengths and weaknesses? Does my perception of myself align with how others see me? Where are I confident about my skills and abilities? <br>
<br>
<b>Self Control</b> - How well you manage your emotions and actions, what can I do  to manage myself when under stress? How do my values shape my decisions and actions? When do I take the initiative to solve problems? How do I support my continued growth and development?<br>
<br>
<b>Awareness of others</b> - Emotions, Strengths, Weaknesses, needs, preferences, values. Do you know how to accurately read others emotions, both individually and in group settings? Can you anticipate the feelings, needs and concerns of others? How do you cultivate appreciation of diverse thoughts and experiences?<br>
<br>
<b>Building Relationships</b> - How we utilize our awareness of others to maximize their potential and our relationship. How do you help others achieve their greatest potential, Can you identify healthy and toxic conflict? When do you initiate change and support others people's reaction to it?  Can you inspire others with your passion and confidence?<br>
<br>
Take the official EQ assessment "Emotional and Social Competence Inventory" (ESCI) by Daniel Goleman.<br>
<p>
<h3 id="1b">Why emotions are key</h3>
The brain has three areas of sophistication <br>
Reptilian - Amygdala, fight or flight.<br>
Limbic = Emotional brain, happiness, sadness, disgust, etc.<br>
Neo-cortex = Thinking brain, logical analysis and effective decision making.<br>
<br>
<b>Amygdala Hijack</b><br>
In response to danger the Amygdala can override the other parts of the brain. Our previous experiences influence how we physically and emotionally respond to current events.<br>
<!-- <img src="Images/Amygdala_Hijack.jpg" alt="Amygdala Hijack"> -->
<br>
Not all Amygdala Hijack are fight or flight responses. The Amygdala can release a small amount of hormones that causes a more subtle reaction such as a knot in the stomach or a locked jaw. The limbic brain may be accessible, but certainly not the thinking brain.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3 id="1c">Emotional intelligence at work.</h3>
Regardless of your role, improving your EQ will help your performance.
As a manager you have a responsibility to develop EQ in yourself, others (directs) and the wider organization.
Competence - Proficiency and frequency
Proficiency (skill) - How good you are at something (eg: High, Medium, Low).
Frequency - How often you do something. (eg:90% of the time)

Determine the competency of yourself, others and the org to determine opportunities to improve.

<h3 id="1d">Cultivating emotional intelligence</h3>
Anyone can learn emotional intelligence. 

<hr>
<!--2-->
<h2 id="2">Developing Self Awareness</h2>
<h3 id="2a">Getting to know yourself</h3>
At the core of emotional intelligence is knowing yourself, everything else flows from there so it should be your first focus.<br>
<ol>
<li>Emotions - Know and allow yourself to feel and express appropriately.<br>
<li>Values - the attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and experiences that govern how you behave. It can help to write your life history, eg: Key experiences: Family life, Education, Cultural, major successes or failures, traumatic events, hopes & aspirations.
<li>Skills - Identify which skills are required for your role, and assess where you are exceptional, acceptable, or need development. The Strength finders books can be useful.<br>
<li>Communication style - (Passive, Assertive, Aggressive)
Communication pattern - Linear or circular.
<li>Work Style - knowing how you approach work. DiSC assessment.
<li>Personality or temperament - Myers brigs, Keirsey temperament sorter.
<li>Conflict Style - Thomas-Kilmann Conflict mode instrument.
<li>Leadership Style - Leadership practices inventory, or situational leadership style.
</ol>

<h3 id="2b">Understanding feelings</h3>
Emotions contain rich and powerful information. We need to identify your emotions before we can identify then in others.
<ol>
<li>Identify the emotion.
	<ul>
	<li>Think about how you feel, while you are experiencing different emotions. Eg: Happy Sad, Anger, Disgust, Shame, etc.
	<li>Look for patterns, do you feel the same way in certain situations, Eg: happy when you see your dog or in a meeting.
	<li>Identify the nuances between different emotions. Eg: What's the difference between feeling embarrassment, guilt, humiliation or shame?
	</ul>
<li>Acknowledge the emotion.
We need to make time to feel the emotion.

<li>Appropriately express your feelings.
	<ul>
	<li>Don't let emotions build up.
	<li>Never act when your Amygdala has been hijacked.
	<li>Learn to speak authentically about what you are feeling and what you want.
	</ul>
</ol>

<h3 id="2c">Perceiving yourself accurately</h3>
This is about aligning how you see yourself with how others perceive you.

<ol>
<li> Identify your strengths - Acknowledging what you are good at. What are things you get compliments about, friends about, etc. What comes easily or your really enjoy.
<li> Learn from your experiences and improve. Each success is built on many failures. So fail fast!
<li> Be open to hearing candid feedback.<br>
Tips for taking feedback...
	<ul>
	<li>Don't respond to critical feedback for at least 24 hours, to allow time to feel feelings and consider.
	<li>Is this feedback an issue of proficiency (improve a skill) or frequency (I need to do something more or less often?)
	<li>What are their priorities.
	<li>How is my work serving the needs of the organization or my supervisors success?
	<li>Can they see my contribution? if not, why?
	<li>What does their feedback tell me about how my perception relates to theirs?
	<li>What can I learn from this?
	<li>What feelings did this feedback bring up?
	</ul>
</ol>


<h3 id="2d">Cultivating confidence</h3>
People with a healthy level of self-esteem and confidence are more effective at managing themselves and others.
Confidence - having a strong sense of your self-worth and capabilities.
<ol>
<li>Know and honoring your strengths. This is a sign of emotional intelligence.
<li>Leverage your strengths by using them strategically. Find ways to bring them to situations. How can you use those strengths to support your supervisor, your department or your organization.<br>
Use your skills to...
	<ul>
	<li>Support success
	<li>Solve problems
	<li>Build similar strengths

<li>Build your self-worth of self-esteem
You should talk to yourself like you would others, and not be demeaning.<br>
A key to building self-esteem is positive self talk.<br>
When you think about mistakes you make, focus on behaviors to improve, rather than being subjective. Eg: I should have researched that better, rather than, I'm an idiot I always mess up.<br>
</ol>

<!--3-->
<hr>
<h2 id="3">Developing Self Regulation</h2>
<h3 id="3a">Exercising emotional self-control</h3>
We need to exercise emotional self control both when under stress and in everyday interactions.<br>
<br>
<b>Under Stress</b>
<ol>
<li>Recognize the symptoms of an Amygdala hijack. These may be a racing heart, clenched stomach, shaking hands, there are also more subtle signs.
<li>Have some ways to calm yourself down.
	<ul>
	<li>Excuse yourself from the situation, (eg: bathroom break)
	<li>Breathing
	<li>Journaling
	<li>Moving (eg: walking)
	<li>Venting with a trusted friend
	</ul>
</ol>
<b style=color:red>Most importantly don't take action while your Amygdala is hijacked.</b><br>
<br>

<b>Everyday interactions</b><br>
EQ here is about thinking beyond the current moment to the broader situation.
<ul>
<li> Starting a conversation without appropriate privacy.
<li> Making a decision without all of the facts.
<li> Taking an action without assessing all the different people it might effect or what the impact might be.
<li> Feeling compelled to share information because someone asks.
</ul>
The key here is to wait and give yourself time to think and act. You also get the opportunity to ask questions and get other perspectives.<br>


<h3 id="3b">Working with your triggers</h3>
Emotional trigger activation is when emotions are bigger than the situation warrants.<br>
This occurrs because we have some previous emotional experience and the current situation is amplified by that previous experience.<br>

Reactions that suggest you are triggered include feeling Righteous, Angry, Defensive, Scared, Anxious, Judging or blaming, self-critical and beating yourself up, or experiencing the fight or flight response.<br>
Fight responses...
<ul>
<li>Aggression
<li>Physical, verbal, non-verbal attacks
<li>Sarcasm
<li>Shame
</ul>

Flight responses...
<ul>
<li>Turn away or withdraw
<li>Defensiveness
<li>Excuses, disagreeing
<li>Blame shifting
</ul>

Actions<br>
<ul>
<li> Make a list of what has triggered you over the past couple of years, both personally and professionally.
<li> Make a plan for managing the triggers.
</ul>
Triggers are at the heart or most workplace conflict. Almost 50% of people have had some kind of serious experiences that can lead to triggers.<br>
For more information about triggers, review the course: Having difficult conversations.<br>

<h3 id ="3c">Living with integrity</h3>
Living with Integrity is about knowing your values and living in alignment with them. We earn trust be walking our own walk. Building trust is an ongoing process.<br>
Develop your integrity by...
<ol>
<li>Knowing your core values - know what you stand for.
<li>Share your values with others.
<li>Commit to living your values every day.
<li>Be accountable for your actions. Integrity can be re-established is we own our mistakes.
</ol>
Ethics - a system of principals for what is right and what is wrong, within a given context or community.

<h3 id="3d">Achieving your goals</h3>
Striving to be excellent, setting and achieving goals and taking initiative to find solutions are all hallmarks of emotion intelligence.<br>
<ul>
<li>Achievement drive - The ability to set and achieve goals, then persist to drive them through to completion. Use the S.M.A.R.T goal technique.
<li>Initiative - The willingness to identify problems, create solutions and act on opportunities.
<li>Innovation - The ability to be creative, come up with new ideas, products or methods.
<li>Learning orientation - Your commitment to continual improvement. Embrace life-long learning, be intentional and create a professional development plan that includes...
	<ul>
	<li>What to learn
	<li>How, where and when
	</ul>
Note: Ideally tie the plan to performance reviews.
</ul>
Also look to create a personal development plan, this may be taking courses on photography or becoming a better parent.

<h3 id="3e">Change - Being flexible and agile</h3>
Change is one thing that will be consistent. We want to cultivate our flexibility to change.

<ol>
<li>Become familiar with how you respond to change.
	<ul>
	<li>Conservers - Need a lot of information and time, ask questions, prefer gradual change.
	<li>Originators - Enjoy risk, challenge structures, prefer change to be quick and radical.
	<li>Pragmatists - in between the two, mediators who like to explore the current structure, practical and reasonable, but can be non-committal, want change to serve a function.
	</ul>
<li> Tend to the transition of change - this is the emotional impact of change. There are two components to help managing change...
	<ul>
	<li>Sustainability - Taking care of yourself so you can meet and respond to challenges over time. The keys are exercise, nutrition sleep and play.
	<li>Resilience - the ability to recover quickly from adversity. having a supportive social network, expressing feelings, daily practice of gratitude, sense of humor.
</ul>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2 id="4">Building Awareness of Others</h2>
<h3 id="4a">Getting to know others</h3>
The goal is to engage in a process to increase your awareness of others and if possible help them to do the same.<br>
Questions to ask...
<ul>
<li>What emotions do you see your coworkers display at work?
<li>What values do you think drive your boss and the executives of your company?
<li>What skills does your team need to be successful?
<li>How does your spouse's communication style affect your daily life?
<li>How do the work styles of your co-workers affect the productivity of your group?
<li>In what ways does your boss's temperament shape the work environment they create?
<li>What are your co-workers conflict styles? Do they embrace conflict? Or avoid it at all costs?
<li>How does the leadership style of the top executive in your organization shape your daily experience?
</ul>
The best strategy for learning someone's values is to ask them.<br>
Make a point of observing and asking about people's skills, communication style, etc. Until you have a well rounded sense of them. It can also help to learn together - Eg: by taking a work style or temperament indicator together.<br>


<h3 id="4b">Developing empathy</h3>
Empathy - The awareness of and connection to others needs, feelings and concerns. We can get insights by
<ol>
<li>Listening to their words, also listen for their feelings: they often use words like "anxious" or "overwhelmed" in their sentences. 
<li>Read their facial expressions: Eye corners crinkled when happy, or wide open when surprised, or we blink faster when scared.
<li>Listen to their voice. Angry when loud and terse, or excited when talking faster and at a higher pitch.
<li>Watch body language: Arms open is closeness, arms crossed can mean defensive or closed, leaning towards you indicates expresses interest, leaning away or facing away indicates being closed off.
<li>Assess consistency - When words, facial expressions, body language are inconsistent this could indicate they are distracted, deflecting the truth or lying, uncomfortable.
<li> Asking people directly.
</ol>

<h3 id="4c">Anticipating needs</h3>
Empathy is connecting to people's experience as <b>they</b> feel it.<br>
Empathy is the pathway to authentically motivating and engaging your employees. When we come to know people very well, and start to understand them on a deep level, you can then begin to identify their needs and concerns, even anticipating them.<br>
<br>
It's important not to think how we would feel in the same situation, as that could lead us to have opinions about their feelings, or offer them advice that would work for us (avoid things like, "What you need to do is...", or "Your over reacting, its not really that bad.".<br>
<br>
A good method is to identify the feeling they are having, then recalling a time you felt the same way.<br>
<br>

<h3 id="4d">Cultivating social awareness</h3>
Social awareness is applying empathy to social settings. During a pitch, meeting or presentation. This means reading the verbal and non-verbal clues and adjusting your communications. Such as identifying whether people are understanding or not, bored or engaged, etc.<br>
<br>
Political and Organizational acumen is creating an understanding of the unwritten norms of a group or organization. This is done by observing what is said and how the collecting group responds to its members. In some groups speaking up is seen as leadership, in others it's disrespectful. This doesn't mean don't speak up, but rather wait for the right opportunities and understand the consequences for doing so.<br>0
<br>

<h3 id="4e">Appreciating diversity</h3>
Appreciating diversity helps your relatability to others and is key to building relationships.<br>

Individual diversity - Everyone is unique, with differing backgrounds and life experiences. People also have different strengths. Identifying and highlighting people's strengths can help improve your and your groups appreciation of diversity.<br>
<br>
One way to help develop appreciation for diversity is through group learning. This might be an assessment of work style or leadership. This can help everyone gain a greater appreciation for their colleagues and learn that they couldn't be successful without each other.<br>

Culture - Learned beliefs, values, rules norms, symbols, and traditions that are common to a group of people. <br>
<br>
Cultural group diversity - Every society consists of groups with a shared culture. Culture can be based on race, religion, ethnicity, geographic region, even workplace.<br>
<br>
Cultural competence - The awareness of how various aspects of culture shape a person or group's experiences, attitudes, values and behaviors.<br>

	<li>Compromising - Both get some of your needs and lose others.
	<li>Collaborating - Work together to find a new solution that meets both of your needs.
</ul>

When conflict does arise...
<ul>
<li>Avoid stepping in too quickly as long as the conflict is not toxic.
<li>Support people in working our their conflict, empower them to take responsibility for the situation.
<li> Ask them what's going on and how they want to resolve it.
</ul>

<h3 id="5e">Being a change catalyst</h3>

Look for contrary data and alternate theories.
Be willing to champion the change. Inspire with passion and cultivate advocates. Model the change.

<h3 id="53">Building influence</h3>
